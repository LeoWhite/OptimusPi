OptimusPi
=========

This is the source code that will be used for my PiWars 2015 entry 'OptimusPi'.
Currently OptimusPi is a scratch built robot made from plywood and some pieces
of plastic piping to hold the motors. The brains is, of course, a Raspberry Pi
(currently a Model A+) with an Arduino being used as a motor controller (Its
responsibilities may be expanded upon later).

Remote control of the robot was done via a Sony PlayStation 3 DualShock controller, 
connected via BlueTooth to the Raspberry Pi.
