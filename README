OptimusPi
=========

This is the source code that will be used for my PiWars 2015 entry 'OptimusPi'.
Currently OptimusPi is a scratch built robot made from plywood and some pieces
of plastic piping to hold the motors. The brains is, of course, a Raspberry Pi
(currently a Model A+) with an Arduino being used as a motor controller (Its
responsibilities may be expanded upon later).

Remote control of the robot is planned to be  via a Sony PlayStation 3 DualShock controller, 
connected via BlueTooth to the Raspberry Pi.

Autonomous control will be dealt with by a variety of sensors.

Installation
============


Raspberry Pi
===========
 
 - Flash SD Card with Raspbian NoX image (20150804-raspbian-wheezy-1-noX.zip)
 - Expand file system, enable i2c and change device name to OptimusPi via raspi-config
 - sudo apt-get update
 - sudo apt-get upgrade
 - Instal PiGPIO library (http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/)
 - Install i2c tools (sudo apt-get install i2c-tools)
 - Add i2c-dev to /etc/modules

 - Install libevdev
   Currently this isn't in the repository so we need to run
   - wget http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/libe/libevdev/libevdev2_1.3+dfsg-1_armhf.deb
   - wget http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/libe/libevdev/libevdev-dev_1.3+dfsg-1_armhf.deb
   - sudo dpkg -i libevdev2_1.3+dfsg-1_armhf.deb
   - sudo apt-get install libjs-jquery
   - sudo dpkg -i  libevdev-dev_1.3+dfsg-1_armhf.deb

 - Install ArduiPi_OLED library (https://github.com/hallard/ArduiPi_OLED)
 
 - Install GCC 4.9 (https://solarianprogrammer.com/2015/01/13/raspberry-pi-raspbian-install-gcc-compile-cpp-14-programs/)

 - Install GIT (sudo apt-get install git)
 - Check out repository (git clone git@github.com:LeoWhite/OptimusPi.git)
 - Build source
   cd OptimusPi
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-4.9 -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-4.9 ../src/
   make

 - Install support for PS3 controller (Article in https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi-issues/MagPiSE1.pdf)
  
 Optional
